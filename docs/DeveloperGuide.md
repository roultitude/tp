### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `list`.

<img src="images/RerollArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />
<img src="images/RerollStorageSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

Each of the main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/RerollUiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ViewModePanel`
, `EditModePanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart`
class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Entity` objects residing in the `Model`.

The `ListModePanel` and `ViewModePanel` are UI elements that contain the necessary components to display the regular
operating mode and the view / edit mode of Reroll respectively. Upon being triggered by the appropriate
`CommandResult`, the `UI` switches modes through `SwitchUiMode`, unparenting the previous (`ListModePanel` by default),
and parenting the alternative panel to `MainWindow`.

![Sequence flow of switching to Edit Mode](images/RerollEditModeSequenceDiagram.png)

This is to create a seamless transition for the user and to free up screen real estate when not in view / edit mode.
`ViewModePanel` contains a `EntityDetailsPanel`, which fetches entity data from `Model` after every command executed in
edit mode to ensure that the user is kept up to date with changes.

### Logic component

**
API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/RerollLogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `RerollParser` or `EditModeParser` class to parse
   the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `MakeCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a entity).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete char Leeroy` Command](images/RerollDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/RerollParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `RerollParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `MakeCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `MakeCommand`) which the `RerollParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `MakeCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<img src="images/RerollLogicActivityDiagram.png" width="600"/>

`Logic` keeps a boolean `isInEditMode` as runtime state that determines which of `RerollParser`
and `EditModeParser`
to use for incoming commands. `EditModeParser` differs in that it treats all user input as a `EditValueCommand`, which
allows us to simplify the syntax for that command to simply `<FIELD> <VALUE>` as opposed to `<COMMAND> <FIELD> <VALUE>`.
This is done to smoothen the experience for the end user, who might need to edit many fields in a short period of time.

### Model component

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-q-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/RerollModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores Reroll data i.e., all `Entity` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEntityList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Entity` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

**Note:** `RerollAllEntities`, the class which stores all entities, is abstracted from `Reroll`, to support future
functionality outside of entity list manipulation.

### Storage component

**
API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/RerollStorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both Reroll data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RerollStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Entities

![Entities in Reroll](images/RerollEntityClassDiagram.png)

In order to facilitate operations and management of various aspects of user data, we have split entities into 3 classes
implementing the `Entity` interface.

Each class holds their own the classification-specific fields while exposing the data for the `Ui` thru the interface
method `getFields`.

#### Inventory

Characters and Mobs in Reroll contain an `Inventory`, which can contain references to up to any number of `Item`s. Do
note that these `Item` are added to the inventory as a immutable copy of the item when the `inventory add` command is
used in edit mode.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Make entity feature

#### Design considerations

In Reroll, there are 3 different entity classes (`Character`, `Mob`, `Item`) that users can keep track of. Each class
has a set of unique fields to keep track of, resulting in a combined number of ~15 fields to keep track of. Thus, it is
important to minimize mental load on the user during the creation of new entities.

#### Alternative approaches

1. **Current design**: Minimal make command with new syntax \
   Sample command: `make char King Arthur` - makes a new Character that has the name _King Arthur_ \
   This approach only allows users to create an entity with a given name, all other fields can only be filled in using
   the `edit` command. This allows users to create entities quickly by eliminating the need to input prefixes.
2. Alternative: Reuse AB3 syntax, allow user to enter all fields at once \
   Sample command: `make char n/King Arthur str/10 dex/5 int/3 ...` - makes a new Character with all the specified
   fields\
   This approach allows users to create detailed entities with just one command. However, usage of prefixes such as `n/`
   increases the mental load on the user to keep track of all the different prefixes, and increases their chance of
   making mistakes while inputting commands.

#### [Proposed extension]

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the entity being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Our key target user group is Table-Top Role Playing Game(TTRPG) players looking for a powerful entity management system
for their gameplay.

The people in our user group who would benefit most from this product generally would have the following qualities:

* Need or struggle to store large repository of past ideas, including story, characters, monsters and items
* Type fast and prefer CLI
* Need inspiration for character, item and monster creation that a randomizer would help address

**Value proposition**:

Our product is a more expansive and well-organized system capable of managing TTRPG entities better than a traditional
pen and paper format.

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 500 _entities_ without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The application is not required to be compatible with any existing tracking applications.
5. The application should be usable by new players not familiar with RPG trackers.

### Glossary

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Future enhancements are planned to improve Reroll.

1. Currently, fields such as weight, cost and challenge rating accepts negative values. Parser will be updated to detect
   such invalid values and print an error message.
2. More case-insensitive commands will be implemented. Currently [CLASSIFICATION] must be in lowercase to work, causing
   confusion among the testers.
3. Entities with very long name does not wrap in the GUI. Changes to GUI to remedy this is expected.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample entities. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a entity

1. Deleting a entity while all entities are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all entities using the `list` command. Multiple entities in the list.

    2. Test case: `delete char Leeroy`<br>
       Expected: Character named Leeroy is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted entity shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    3. Test case: `delete char`<br>
       Expected: No entity is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete garbage` <br>

       Expected: Similar to previous.
